# Tip Time

## Introduction
- This project uses Jetpack Compose to build an interactive tip calculator that automatically calculates the tip amount when you enter the service amount. 
- Building this app was part of my learning in Makers Module 3 - Mobile Applications: Android applications.
- It follows the official [Android documentation tutorial](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-using-state#0)
